# steamy

_Steamy is a simple deployment solution that aim to be fast and real easy to use._

## introduction

**Steamy** is a complete solution for deployment. It doesn't try to replace or be opiniated about the tool you use to provision, start or monitor you app. It simply manages build artifacts, apps & their environments and deployments you make.

This project is composed of three sub-components:

- `steamy-ui` The user interface you as a human will interact with.
- `steamy-api` The place where all the state and history of you deployments is kept.
- `steamy-agent` The program that will on you target server ready to pull in new code when asked.
- `steamy-cli` A command line tool to access **steamy**'s information and trigger deploys (as an alternative to the UI).
