Go to the "Project Settings" page and copy you project's unique webhook url:

The last step is to navigate to your project's repo on GitHub and go to the
**"Settings"** tab and then, to the **"Webhooks & services"** link in the sidebar.

From there you can click on **"Add webhook"** and fill in the form as shown in
the picture below:
