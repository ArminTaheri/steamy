# example-app

This folder is an demo app to help you see what using *steamy* is like.

## instructions

This folder has a `Vagrantfile` that will let you create a demo environment
to test *steamy* out easily.

**Step 1**

Create the vagrant VM:

```
user@laptop:example-app$ vagrant up
```

This will create a new virtual machine with the `steamy-api`, `steamy-ui` and
`steamy-cli` installed.
